## Description

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this application, I must architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## User Story
```
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business.
